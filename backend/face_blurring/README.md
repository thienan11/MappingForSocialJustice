# Mapping for Social Justice - Face Blurring

This is a copy, refer to the original [`face_blurring`](/face_blurring/README.md) directory for more information.

## TODO

- Need to find a solution to streamline the face blurring and uploading process. Currently, incorporating the YOLOv8 face blurring models into the flask backend is making the uploading process very slow.

- For some reason, mp4 videos are broken (can't be viewed) when uploaded through the flask backend w/ the face blurring program added (nodejs backend without the face blruring works w/ .mp4).
