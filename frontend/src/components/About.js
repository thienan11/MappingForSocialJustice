        This research endeavors to develop an ethically sound tool that merges architecture, urban design, social justice, 
        and technology to document, analyze, and protect content related to historical events and protests. It aims to harness
        data-driven insights to advance social justice, offering a multi-disciplinary approach for a more equitable society.
        By creating a comprehensive image/video archiving and analysis platform, the project automates cloud-based archiving,
        ensures data privacy, and fosters accessibility. Through innovative methodologies and interdisciplinary collaboration,
        it illuminates spatial aspects of social justice, leveraging cutting-edge technology to address contemporary injustices
        and promote equity and justice initiatives effectively.
